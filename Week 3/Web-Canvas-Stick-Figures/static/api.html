<h1>API description for stick figure diamond hunt</h1>

<p>This server provides three resources with the following methods:

<p>get on /api/diamonds/ will list the diamonds currently in play (this call will return when the list of diamonds next changes so it's OK for long polling)
<p>delete on /api/diamonds/42?user=p340x459&amp;name=Jack will attempt to claim the diamond 42 - either it returns 200 in which case the diamond is yours, or it returns 404 in which case somebody claimed the diamond before you; the user ID is generated by the client on load, the name is provided by the user and can freely change
<p>get on /api/scores/ will list all the scores known to the server
