Node: Installing Node + Git

This week's practical will not run in the standard Windows Shell (cmd or Powershell). You need to use Git Bash.

If you are using your own machine - if you don't have Git installed already, install it and run Git Bash (you will also need to install node).
If you would like to run node locally on a campus machine - follow this guide
Or use your VM. WinSCP can automatically sync for editing locally, see this guide.
