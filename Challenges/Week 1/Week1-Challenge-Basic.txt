Basic JS â€” Worksheet

This week you'll tackle a series of unit tests that will give you a chance to get familiar with javascript basics.
Challenges

    Get a copy of the code at https://github.com/portsoc/ws_basicjs onto your local machine.
    Open index.js and, in an editor modify the id, fn and sn functions:
        The id function should return your student ID.
        The fn function should return your first name.
        The sn function should return your surname.
    Open index.html in a browser and observe that:
        not all the tests pass
        there are three tests concerning the id, fn and sn functions that should pass.
    This week there are multiple test files which follow the naming convention assess.subject.js - you should read the unit tests in each of these files and attempt to make them pass by implementing code in the index.js file.
        Note that you have already satisfied the tests in assess.basics.js by returning your id and name.
        Notice that some of the tests use a compare function. One of your tasks is to write that function, so you should recognise that any tests which use it cannot pass until it is written and correct! :-)
    If you have questions, ask each other, and ask us.
