CSS3: Grid Layout and Custom Properties - Worksheet

Your task this week is to perform your own research into how recent advances in CSS can help you write better,
cleaner, faster, and more maintainable code.  Anything that's been published since CSS2.1 (June 2011) is fair game.
Go and find something you've not seen before, or want to understand in more detail, and add a subfolder similar to ours,
with examples of what you've discovered.
