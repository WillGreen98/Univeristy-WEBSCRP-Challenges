Welcome to Year 2!

There's no prescriptive hand-holding any more.

Let that sink in for a second. You're the pilot here.

This means you have to think and learn how to go about solving the problems we give you.

You may want to ask each other, before you ask us, if you need a nudge in the right direction.

This week we're getting to grips with retrieving code from Github and editing, running and testing it.
Challenges

    Get a copy of the code at https://github.com/portsoc/wswk1 onto your local machine.
        You might want to manually download it, or use git to clone it (Github Desktop is available through MyApps).

    Open index.html in a browser and observe that not all the tests pass.
        Take some time to familiarise yourself with the information on the page - the debug information is useful.

    Open index.js in an editor and make the changes necessary so that all the tests pass.

    Next, look at assess.js - try to identify and understand the three tests that you've seen running.

    Can you see a problem with the test for the "add" function? Write a better test that fixes the problem (hint: try changing the + to * in the add function and see if the test passes).

    Get your VM started and login to it.
        If you've forgotten how to do this, read the first page of the primer from last year.

    Now, try to do challenges 1 to 3 again, but this time on your VM, using the basic http-server you used last year.
        NB: Command-line git is already installed on your VM.

    Reflect on what skills you needed reminders for, and what new skills you may need to acquire from what you've seen today.
