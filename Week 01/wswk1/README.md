# Web Script Week 1

A few files for cloning.

Hints:
* Always check the README.md for extra information on how to load, configure and run the code.
* You can download a zip, or use the git binary or Github desktop app to clone the code.

Explanation:
* This is a very basic example of a javascript library (index.js) and a set of unit tests (assess.js) for checking the that the library is operating correctly.
* Opening index.html in a browser causes the unit tests to be run.
* By editing index.html all three tests can be made to pass.
