Worksheet: AJAX

AJAX — Worksheet
This week's unit tests test your abilities to discover how to dynamically load page content.

Challenges
1. If you have questions from previous worksheet – ask us early – we may want to discuss any problems you raise with the whole group.
2. Get a copy of the code at https://github.com/portsoc/ws_ajax onto your machine.
    This one works best on your VM or on your own computer with Node.js and NPM set up.
3. Open index.js and modify the id, fn and sn functions:
    The id function should return your student ID.
    The fn function should return your first name.
    The sn function should return your surname.
4. Open index.html in a browser and observe that:
    1. not all the tests pass, but...
    2. there are three tests concerning the id, fn and sn functions that should pass because you changed the functions above; right?
5. The tests are all in assess.ajax.js – attempt to make them pass by implementing code in the index.js file.
6. If you get stuck, ask each other, and ask us.
